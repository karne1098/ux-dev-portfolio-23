                I initially expected this project to be an idealistic UX
                Research, Copy, and Design project. However, because the
                department I was working with had no prior exposure to UX, I
                quickly adapted and focused on determining which key areas of
                their workflow/process needed to be infused with UX strategies.
                Then, I provided informative materials and feasible next steps
                for the team.

        <p>
          At the time, I had only experienced working on UX projects through
          class, where the problem, constraints, solution requirements, and
          tools were clearly provided.
        </p>
        <p className="my-role-in-project">
          Early in the project, I realized that this project would be{" "}
          <b>not idealistic</b>, and I adjusted to the reality of an unclear
          problem space, constraints, and solution space.

          The director of BERDI, who was my main contact, provided a deck

      <h2> Analyzing the Existing BERDI Website</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          Looking at the existing website lead me to a lot of questions. I
          marked places in the existing website that I felt needed more clarity
          or information.
        </p>
        <div className="content-grid lowered-content--small">
          <div className="content-row">
            <div className="content--12">

                alt="comment bubbles on digital document containing numerous pages of the existing BERDI website"
              />
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          While I gained a better understanding of what BERDI had to offer to
          users, I was still unsure how to organize the BERDI content for users.
          To do that, I needed to learn about the user through user research.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2> How much does BERDI know about users? </h2>
      <p>
        After multiple conversations with the Lifespan web team leader and the
        BERDI director, I came to several conclusions about the extent to which
        users were understood.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Speculated User Types</h3>
        <p>
          There's a wide and unknown range of demographics potentially using the
          site: residents, fellows, med students, researchers, and more...
        </p>
        <div className="content-grid lowered-content--small">
          <div className="content-row">
            <div className="content--12">
              <img
                src={berdiUsers}
                alt="nurses, doctors, statisticians, and researchers"
              />
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Users have various goals and knowledge of how to achieve those goals.
          The director perceives the frequency of these user types according to
          his role as the point person for users who need help navigating the
          BERDI center.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Users with misguided but targeted goals regarding what they need
          </li>
          <li>
            Users with accurate and targeted goals regarding what they need
            (rare)
          </li>
          <li>
            Users with no idea what they need or who to ask, but has somehow

      <section>
        <h3>No Access to Critical User Base</h3>
        <p>
          BERDI currently does not have access to users who unsuccessfully tried
          to set an appointment or users who interact with the site for
          non-appointment reasons (such as learning about Citrix Biostat Desktop
          or REDCap Bits).
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2> Solidifying the Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        After exploring BERDI's existing site, access and understanding of
        users, and project constraints, I came to three major objectives.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>The problem statement</h3>

                  the user will interact with.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Create logical navigation and organization of site pages.

      </section>
      <h2>1. Developing distinct, concise, useful content</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Deciding on a Feasible Plan</h3>
        <p>
          The ideal actions would be interview a broad base of users and consult
          the experts in each subgroup of the BERDI organization. However, I had
          neither the access to a diverse group of users nor the time needed for
          the experts to get back to me.
        </p>
        <img
          src={berdiTimeline}
          alt="hand holding am hourglass and people discussing scheduling in front of a calendar"
        />
        <p className="my-role-in-project">
          The director and I decided that the most feasible next step would be
          for me to send him a content request for any information I believed to
          be missing.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Writing up a Content Request</h3>
        <p>
          It would be a 6 page document, and it contained questions for each of
          the tabs within our preliminary new content categories: About Us, How
          Can We Help?, Schedule an Appointment, Levels of Service, Research
          Resources, and FAQ.

          Each subcategory of content had a “Content DxH needs” section in the
          document, which contained our specific questions for that subcategory
          of content. This consistency would allow the director and stakeholders
          to work through the document without confusion.

        <h3>Considering Futurity</h3>
        <p>
          The director would be able to delegate questions he couldn't answer to
          other experts. Since the company was experiencing internal corporate
          changes, providing the BERDI director with this compact and extensive
          document would give him the time and space he needed to generate the
          content.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2>2. Create Logical Navigation and Organization</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Run a Virtual Card Sorting Activity</h3>
        <p>
          Virtual Card Sorting is a method that reveals how a user organizes
          information in a way that is natural to them. It tells us what
          groupings, hierarchies, and models they might have about the parts of
          the site.
        </p>
        <p className="my-role-in-project">
          I recommend virtual card sorting as a feasible method because it is
          low commitment, no cost, and BERDI has some access to users that
          successfully set appointments.
        </p>

        <h3>UX Research Methods Overview Document</h3>
        <p>
          I detail important qualitative methods (user interviews, stakeholder
          interviews, usability tests), quantitative methods (card sorts, click
          tests, A/B tests), and mixed methods (task analysis, user/web
          analytics, and accessibility tests). For each method, I describe its
          impact, process, logistics, potential participants, and justifications
          of use.

      <h2>My Experience with Project Management</h2>

        <h3> Onboarding a New Team Member</h3>
        <p>
          Midway into the project, I realized that my role was as much a Project
          Manager as a UX consultant. This realization came when a new student
          member joined the project from Brown, and I was the one to create an
          onboarding process for her.
        </p>
        <p className="my-role-in-project">
          I created a “Project Summary” document that included all the
          developments I'd made so far in the project including Project Goals,
          Design/Technical Limitations, and Insights on BERDI Site.

        <h3>Week to Week Tasks as a Pseudo Project Manager</h3>
        <p>
          I was constantly weighing what was feasible, what people in the team
          had capacity for, and what would be most impactful for BERDI. I was
          communicating with different BERDI stakeholders, experts, and
          cross-functional groups and relaying information between them and the
          Design x Health team. I was scheduling meetings, taking meeting notes,
          and organizing documentation.
